So of course, one limitation is - images. You can't just feed the tool a list of URLs and say \"get these for me.\"</p>\n<p>So I went down the road of <a href=\"https://linuxize.com/post/wget-command-examples/\">wget</a> - and of course, I didn't think of this at the beginning, and it took a conversation where I had to say it out loud to figure it out (thanks to a co-worker for talking about the idea with me, which gave me the keywords I wasn't using to stumble upon <code class=\"language-text\">wget</code> as the solution, duh).</p>\n<p>It's super simple and easy to use, which made it more facepalming for not using it to begin with. Granted, I had to convert a CSV file with syntax issues galore and figure out the direct URL structure to get the downloads to actually work properly - but all the work I did to use a tool, set me up to easilly clean up the data for wget to use.</p>\n<h2>Setup:</h2>\n<p>Of course, <code class=\"language-text\">wget</code> is not included in OSX, so I had to install it using <a href=\"https://brew.sh/\">brew</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">brew install wget</code></pre></div>\n<h2>Syntax (first run):</h2>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">wget -i file_name.txt</code></pre></div>\n<p>...this ran through the file, line-by-line to get the images. Pretty simple, right?</p>\n<h2>Syntax (run in parallel):</h2>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">cat text_file.txt | parallel --gnu &quot;wget {}&quot;</code></pre></div>\n<p>...thanks to <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40986340/how-to-wget-a-list-of-urls-in-a-text-file\">StackOverflow</a> for this one, which would've sped up the process (I was attempting THOUSANDS of images). This ALSO requires you to install <code class=\"language-text\">parallel</code> as it's not a native OSX command, again, simply by <code class=\"language-text\">brew install parallel</code>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://linuxize.com/post/wget-command-examples/\">Additional reading and configuration of <code class=\"language-text\">wget</code></a></li>\n</ul>","timeToRead":1,"frontmatter":{"path":"/getting-a-list-of-images","title":"Getting a List of Images","date":"17th June, 2020.","category":"Code"}}},"pageContext":{}}}
