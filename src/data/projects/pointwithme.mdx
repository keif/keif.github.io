A real-time story pointing and planning poker application for distributed teams to collaboratively estimate work during sprint planning sessions.

Originally created by [Phil Palmieri](https://github.com/philpalmieri/pointwith.me) in 2019, I forked this project in November 2023 to modernize it. When the original author didn't respond to pull requests, I built out my own improved version with extensive modernizations and enhancements.

## Features

- **Real-time Collaboration**: Firebase-powered instant updates across all connected devices
- **Spectator Mode**: Observe poker planning sessions without voting (NEW - Oct 2025)
    - Click your name to toggle between voter and spectator roles
    - Role preference persisted per-table
    - Real-time badge indicators for all participants
- **Fibonacci Voting**: Story pointing using the Fibonacci sequence (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13...)
- **Smart Final Scoring**: Automatic prime number rounding with manual override capability
- **Vote Controls**: Show/hide votes, lock/unlock voting rounds
- **Multiple Auth Options**: OAuth providers (Google, GitHub, Twitter, Facebook, Microsoft) plus anonymous login
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices
- **Statistics Dashboard**: Average, mode, and suggested final scores
- **Security Hardened**: Comprehensive Firebase security rules protecting all data (Oct 2025)

## Modernization Journey

- Initial refactoring and code quality improvements

**October 2025 - Comprehensive Refresh:**

- **Modern Dependencies**: Migrated to pnpm, Vitest, date-fns, lucide-react icons
- **Enhanced UX**: Added toast notifications, improved anonymous login, refined prime number voting system
- **Performance**: Significantly faster build times and better tree-shaking throughout
