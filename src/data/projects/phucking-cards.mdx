A real-time multiplayer party game for 3-20 players. No account required, no ads, no tracking - just create a game, share the party code, and play with friends.

Originally based on [Yusuf Ameri's implementation](https://github.com/yusufameri/cards-against-humanity), this modernized version features significant improvements to mobile UX, real-time synchronization, and game modes.

## Features

- **Real-time Multiplayer**: Socket.IO-powered instant updates across all connected players
- **Flexible Player Count**: 3-20 players per game with automatic judge rotation
- **Round Timers**: Configurable time limits with partial submission support
- **User-Submitted Cards**: Community card submissions with moderation queue and vote tracking
- **Session Persistence**: Redis-backed sessions allow page refreshes without losing game state
- **Multiple Game Modes**:
    - **Rebooting the Universe**: Trade a point for a completely new hand
    - **Packing Heat**: Draw extra cards, keep your favorite
    - **Happy Ending**: Final round is a "Make a Haiku" card
    - **Never Have I Ever**: Discard cards you don't understand (with shame notifications)
    - **God is Dead**: Everyone votes, no single judge
    - **Survival of the Fittest**: Elimination voting until one card remains
- **Mobile-First Touch Support**: Optimized tap and drag interactions for phones and tablets
- **Privacy-Friendly**: No login required, minimal analytics via GoatCounter

## Technical Stack

**Backend:**

- Express.js + Socket.IO for real-time communication
- Redis for session storage and card management
- TypeScript throughout
- Winston for structured logging

**Frontend:**

- React 18 with TypeScript
- Socket.IO client for real-time updates
- React DnD with Touch Backend for desktop drag-drop and mobile tap
- Vite for fast builds

**Infrastructure:**

- Deployed on DigitalOcean
- nginx reverse proxy
- Handles 10-15 concurrent games (30-60 players) with minimal load

## Recent Improvements

**Mobile UX Enhancements:**

- Fixed touch event recognition by eliminating `delayTouchStart` delay
- Added device-specific instructions (tap vs. pick)
- Improved carousel swipe interactions

**Real-Time Reliability:**

- Fixed timeout state propagation by implementing dynamic callback updates
- Added explicit `setRoundFinishedNotifier()` method for long-lived game instances
- Enhanced Socket.IO room management for better broadcast reliability

**Content Moderation:**

- Spam detection for similar card submissions
- Rate limiting (10 cards per hour per session)
- Admin moderation queue with approve/reject workflow
