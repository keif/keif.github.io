description: A Python script to automatically clean up GitHub notifications by marking closed or merged issues and pull requests as done.
---

import GistEmbed from "@/components/GistEmbed.astro";

If you use GitHub heavily, your notifications probably look like mine did: hundreds of closed or merged items that never got marked as done.

I got tired of manually clearing them, so I wrote a Python script that does it automatically:

- Connects to GitHub with a personal access token
- Finds closed/merged issues and PRs in your notifications
- Marks them as done
- Logs everything so you know what happened

Run it once, set it up as a cron job, or just run it whenever your inbox gets messy.

Hereâ€™s the full script:

<GistEmbed user="keif" id="ece2fa9372d038f89a64ab14895ce462" />

### Usage

Run it a few different ways:

```bash
# Mark all notifications as done
python mark_as_done.py --all

# Mark notifications from a specific repo
python mark_as_done.py --repo owner/repo

# Use a custom GitHub token
python mark_as_done.py --token YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN
```

### What's in This Version

- Error handling for API issues
- Rate limiting protection
- Better detection for closed/merged items
- Decent logging so you can see what happened
- CLI for easy usage
