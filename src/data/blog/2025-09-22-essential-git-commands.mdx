Working with Git day-to-day can feel like second nature—until you hit one of those moments where you wish you knew the *right* command.

After years of tripping over the same pain points, here's a practical list of Git commands that act like superpowers.

---

## 1. `git reflog` – *The Time Machine*
Accidentally deleted a branch? Reset to the wrong commit?
Reflog is your safety net.

```bash
git reflog
# Find your lost commit hash
git checkout -b recovery-branch <hash>
```

---

2. `git bisect` – The Bug Hunter

You know something broke, but not when? Let Git binary search it for you.

```bash
git bisect start
git bisect bad HEAD
git bisect good <known-good-commit>
# Git guides you to the offending commit
```

---

3. `git stash --include-untracked` – The Context Switcher

Need to switch branches but don't want to commit messy work?

```bash
git stash push -u -m "work in progress on feature X"
# Do work on another branch
git stash pop
```

---

4. `git cherry-pick` – The Surgical Strike

Grab just the commit(s) you want from another branch.

```bash
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>

# Or for a range:
git cherry-pick <start-hash>^..<end-hash>
```

---

5. `git worktree` – The Parallel Universe

Work on multiple branches at once in separate directories.

```bash
git worktree add ../feature-branch feature-branch
# Now you have two working directories for the same repo
```

---

6. `git clean` – The Janitor

Clear out untracked files and directories.
Perfect for cleaning up after switching branches.

```bash
git clean -fd
```

---

7. `git shortlog` – The Historian

Summarize commits by author or message.
Useful for release notes or contributor stats.

```bash
git shortlog -sn
```

---

8. `git blame` – The Detective

Find out who last touched a specific line of code.

```bash
git blame <file>
```

---

9. `git log --graph` – The Storyteller

Get a clean, visual commit history.

```bash
git log --graph --oneline --decorate --all
```

---

10. `git reset` – The Undo Button

Rollback commits safely, either keeping or discarding changes.

```bash
# Keep changes staged
git reset --soft <commit>

# Discard changes completely
git reset --hard <commit>
```

---

## Honorable Mentions: Modern Alternatives

- `git switch -c new-branch` → friendlier than `git checkout -b`
   - Why? Because `git switch` is dedicated just to switching/creating branches, while `git checkout` is overloaded (it can also reset files, detach HEAD, etc.). This makes `switch` safer, clearer, and easier to learn.
- `git restore <file>` → safer way to discard changes
   - Why? Because `git restore` only affects working directory changes, while `git checkout` could also switch branches or detach `HEAD`. This narrower scope makes it less error-prone for beginners.

## Wrapping Up

These aren't obscure tricks — they're practical tools that save time, frustration, and sometimes entire projects.
Mastering them means fewer “oh no” moments and faster context switching.
