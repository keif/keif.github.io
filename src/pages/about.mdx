Hi, I'm **Keith Baker** — a software engineer, hope consultant, maker, breaker, and tinkerer of all things dev, data, and home automation.

By day, I work on systems that power pharmacy payments, healthcare infrastructure, and dev tooling at scale. By night, I dive into whatever fun idea I can't shake - from Raspberry Pi dashboards and React Native apps to Kubernetes pipelines and weird shell hacks.

This blog is a digital catch-all: a place to log what I've learned, share code snippets I don’t want to forget, explore ideas, document experiments, and sometimes just write for the sake of clarity.

### Topics I write about
- Developer workflows (CI/CD, testing, version control)
- Infrastructure & ops (Kubernetes, Docker, Helm)
- Code patterns & problem-solving (Python, Go, JS/TS)
- React Native + mobile app adventures
- Occasional food musings, recipes, and experiments

Thanks for stopping by. If anything you find here helps you build something cool — that's the best outcome I could hope for.
