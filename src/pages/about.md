Hello, my name is Keith, and welcome to yet another about page. Over the years, I've held a wide variety of titles, which really has made them ultimately useless. Previous titles include: Web Developer, Web Architect, Solutions Architect, Hope Consultant, Sales Consultant, and Digital Engineer.

I don't rank these technologies as "preferrred" or "I'm a master of" - technology constantly moves forward at a fast-pace, and one day you feel like a master, and the next day a new paradigm comes along and you feel like you're just coming to terms with it again.

I define my technology knowledge as "always willing to learn more" and "never shying from a challenge" but also "never afraid to say no."

## Code Played With:

* JavaScript
    * [VanillaJS](http://vanilla-js.com/) - the #1 JavaScript Framework used by every major internet property
    * [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) - my preferred JavaScript toolkit
    * [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)
    * [Angular 2](https://angular.io/)
    * [Angular 1.x](https://angularjs.org/)
    * [Backbone](https://backbonejs.org/)
    * [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) (in its various iterations)
    * [jQuery UI](https://jqueryui.com/), because evidently it deserves its own line
    * [MooTools](https://mootools.net/)
    * [Dojo Toolkit](https://dojotoolkit.org/)
    * [Prototype](http://prototypejs.org/)
    * [Scriptaculous](https://script.aculo.us/)
    * [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* HTML (Yes, XHTML, and HTML5)
* CSS (Yes, CSS 2 and 3)
* [Java](https://www.java.com/en/) (which is different than JavaScript, recruiters)
    * [Java Spring](https://spring.io/)
* [PHP](https://www.php.net/)
    * [CodeIgniter](https://codeigniter.com/)
    * [Laravel](https://laravel.com/)
    * [Zend](http://www.zend.com/)
    * [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/)
* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* MySQL, MSSQL, MongoDB, Redis, NOSQL, etc. etc.
* .net (both old school ASP.net and newer MVC)
* XML/XSLT
* [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)
    * [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/)
* Build Tools
    * [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/)
    * [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/)

Point being, I work in technology, I’ve had to delve into different programming paradigms as the client/project called for it. I have no qualms about having to be handed a new technology and learn it, or worse, handed an outdated legacy project and being asked, “can you fix this? We don’t want to upgrade…” - and that’s the first time I becamse acquainted with TinyInt in databases. Primary Key was a TinyInt. It hit the max and just stopped updating. So. Much. Fun.

### Special Thanks

After working with Gatsby, React, and GraphQL, [Stefan Ivić](https://stefanivic.com/) pointed me to his github repo to help me jumpstart my blog!
