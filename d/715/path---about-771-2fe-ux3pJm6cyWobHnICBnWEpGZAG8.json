{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Hi, I am Stefan. I like to build things, debug things, and, most of all, to keep learning.</p>\n<p>I enjoy designing user interfaces. Combining both user experience research and accessibility.\nI am a big fan of tech and science, with passion for Astronomy.</p>\n<br />\n<h4>So, when did you start getting involved with programming ?</h4>\n<p>I would say when I was about 13 years old. At the time I was a part of a gaming community in WoW and my first project involved creating a simple forum in phpBB. I found it very difficult but I enjoyed every second of doing it. Since then, if someone asked me what I wanted to do in life, the answer was always the same. Programming.</p>\n<p>When I was about 18 the term programmer changed into a web developer. Before that I have spent some time learning C# and later Java. But I would always return to HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>\n<br />\n<h4>Why front-end ?</h4>\n<p>I tried both back-end and front-end before I made my decision. I found back-end to be much more challenging but not rewarding. </p>\n<p>I have spent time working on something that was very important for the website, but no one would every know. While front-end let me build the actual interface people would interact with.</p>\n<p>It felt so rewarding, it made me feel good.</p>\n<br />\n<h4>How do you plan to move forward with your career ?</h4>\n<p>This is something I am still planing. So far I know two things :</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I want to become an even better developer. </li>\n<li>I want to give back to the community.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This blog is an idea to help me do both. I will write about the struggles I have along the way and how I solved them. It will be a way for me to always look back and see what I went trough, and I hope, a guide for those that struggle with the same.</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/about","title":"About me"}}},"pageContext":{}}
