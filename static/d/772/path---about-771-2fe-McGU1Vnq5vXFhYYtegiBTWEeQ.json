Over the years, I've held a wide variety of titles, which really has made them ultimately useless.

I have no qualms about having to be handed a new technology and learn it, or worse, handed an outdated legacy project and being asked, “can you fix this? We don’t want to upgrade…” - and that’s the first time I becamse acquainted with TinyInt in databases. Primary Key was a TinyInt. It hit the max and just stopped updating.</p>\n<h3>Special Thanks</h3>\n<p>After working with Gatsby, React, and GraphQL, <a href=\"https://stefanivic.com/\">Stefan Ivić</a> pointed me to his github repo to help me jumpstart my blog!</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/about","title":"Who, What, When, Where, and Maybe Why"}}},"pageContext":{}}
