{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>A huge, huge, HUGE problem with modern technology, blogs, and documentation - is how difficult it is to find out how to do a task, and to make sure that the code you're reading about lines up with the version you're working with.</p>\n<p>It used to be that when you looked up a tutorial, it was almost a given that \"this code is going to work\" - beyond plain JavaScript, the days of Dojo, jQuery, and MooTools (and the others I'm not mentioning). You wanted to do something (say, alpha pngs in Internet Explorer) and the code you'd find would work. They'd at least reference the main documentatin, and the variations usually weren't such major changes.</p>\n<p>Then we got to the level of rapid iterations of our tools. I was working with Angular 2.x at a prior gig, and I was digging into different concepts - nothing necessarilly ground breaking, mind you, just looking up certain behaviors and tutorials to see what could be accomplished from the requests of my &#x3C;abbr title=\"User Experience>UX</abbr> counterparts. But the problem I discovered - a lot of people were trying to \"stay at the top of their game\" or \"establish themselves as 'thought-leaders'\" - so they cranked out a lot of tutorials based on <em>bleeding edge</em> code.</p>","timeToRead":1,"frontmatter":{"path":"/gatsby-blog-image","title":"Gatsby Images - adding to your blog","date":"17th February, 2019.","category":"Code"}}},"pageContext":{}}
